# CS50x

This repo is basically a codebase of the programs I wrote back in the days, when I was taking the CS50 course.

Each directory with prefix 'lecture' represents one lecture of CS50 2020. Inside each of them,
generally the code inside directories that starts with 'lab' were written while taking the lecture,
while those that have prefix 'pset' are the 'problem sets' (assignments).

Some of the mini programs I made include:

- C
  - Caesar Cipher
  - Image filter
  - Image recovering
  - Spell checker
- Python
  - DNA tester
