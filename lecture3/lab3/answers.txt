sort1 uses: BUBBLE SORT

How do you know?: It took too long with the 50K random list, but it performed really well (it was the best) with the sorted one.

sort2 uses: MERGE SORT

How do you know?: It went really fast with both of the sorted and the random lists, practically the same thing.

sort3 uses: SELECTION SORT

How do you know?: That's the remainder AND It went relatively fast with both types of lists, practically the same as well, but not as fast as the sort2.
